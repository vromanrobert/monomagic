# monomagic
Mono Magic is a thought experiment involving Magic: The Gathering cards. 
The rules of Mono Magic:
1. All decks are exactly 60 copies of the same card.
2. Legendary rule is ignored.
3. Matches are two games with each deck going first once.
4. Each game win is 1 point, and each game loss is -1 point.
5. There are currently no match ups that can produce a draw within an individual game.
6. Games are replayed until the loser has exhausted all possible options.
7. All other rules of MtG are as normal, including mulligans.
8. Legal decks must be able to win 2-0 against 60 Plains OR
9. Be able to win 2-0 against a deck that satisfies rule 8.

As of the July 2021 release of Adventures in the Forgotten Realms, there are 77 mono magic cards.
This program simulates every possible decision in most the matchups.
